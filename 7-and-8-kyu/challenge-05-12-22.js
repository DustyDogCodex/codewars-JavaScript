By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number. */

/* Given a 2D ( nested ) list ( array, vector, .. ) of size m * n, your task is to find the sum of the minimum values in each row.

For Example:

[ [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]        #  minimum value of row is 1
, [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]        #  minimum value of row is 5
, [ 20, 21, 34, 56, 100 ]  #  minimum value of row is 20

So the function should return 26 because the sum of the minimums is 1 + 5 + 20 = 26.
