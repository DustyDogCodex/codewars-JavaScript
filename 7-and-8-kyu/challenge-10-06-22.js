/* Happy Holidays fellow Code Warriors!

Santa's senior gift organizer Elf developed a way to represent up to 26 gifts by assigning a unique alphabetical character to each gift. After each gift was assigned a character, the gift organizer Elf then joined the characters to form the gift ordering code.

Santa asked his organizer to order the characters in alphabetical order, but the Elf fell asleep from consuming too much hot chocolate and candy canes! Can you help him out?
Sort the Gift Code

Write a function called sortGiftCode/sort_gift_code/SortGiftCode that accepts a string containing up to 26 unique alphabetical characters, and returns a string containing the same characters in alphabetical order.
Examples (Input -- => Output):

"abcdef"                      -- => "abcdef"
"pqksuvy"                     -- => "kpqsuvy"
"zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"  -- => "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

 */

function sortGiftCode(code){
  return code.split('').sort().join('')
}

/* Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

Examples input/output:

XO("ooxx") => true
XO("xooxx") => false
XO("ooxXm") => true
XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
XO("zzoo") => false */

function XO(str) {
    //code here
  const xo_array = str.split('')
  let x_count = 0
  let o_count = 0
  xo_array.forEach(char => {
    char.toLowerCase() == 'x' ? x_count++ : ''
    char.toLowerCase() == 'o' ? o_count++ : ''
  })
  return x_count == o_count
}
