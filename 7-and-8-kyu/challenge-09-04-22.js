/* An NBA game runs 48 minutes (Four 12 minute quarters). Players do not typically play the full game, subbing in and out as necessary. Your job is to extrapolate a player's points per game if they played the full 48 minutes.

Write a function that takes two arguments, ppg (points per game) and mpg (minutes per game) and returns a straight extrapolation of ppg per 48 minutes rounded to the nearest tenth. Return 0 if 0.

Examples:

pointsPer48(12, 20) // 28.8
pointsPer48(10, 10) // 48 
pointsPer48(5, 17) // 14.1 
pointsPer48(0, 0) // 0
 */

/* You must implement a function that returns the difference between the largest and the smallest value in a given list / array (lst) received as the parameter.

    lst contains integers, that means it may contain some negative numbers
    if lst is empty or contains a single element, return 0
    lst is not sorted

[1, 2, 3, 4]   //  returns 3 because 4 -   1  == 3
[1, 2, 3, -4]  //  returns 7 because 3 - (-4) == 7
