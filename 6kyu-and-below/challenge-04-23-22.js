/* Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

    If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
    If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".

/* Nathan loves cycling.

Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

For example:

time = 3 ----> litres = 1

time = 6.7---> litres = 3

time = 11.8--> litres = 5 */

function litres(time) {
  return Math.floor(time*0.5);
}
