/* Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

/* Task:

Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...

Rules:

    You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

    If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00

    You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

Examples:(Input --> Output)

1 --> 1 --> "1.00"
2 --> 1 + 1/4 --> "1.25"
5 --> 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 --> "1.57" */

  // Happy Coding ^_^
  let series = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++){
    series += parseFloat(1/(3*i + 1))
    console.log(series)
  }
  return series.toFixed(2)
}
